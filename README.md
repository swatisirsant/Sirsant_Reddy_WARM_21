Sample codes developed and used for paper "Optimal Design of Pipe Networks Accounting for Future Demands and Phased Expansion using Integrated Dynamic Programming and Differential Evolution Approach"
This repository consists of MATLAB codes for flexible design method, DP and SADE-DP method for WDN expansion. The details of the files are as follows:

Res_TL: Function to estimate the resiliency for the initial Two loop pipe network

Res_TL_exp2: Function to estimate the resiliency for the TL WDN with parallel pipes being added to the initial pipes

SADE_DP_TL: Main function for designing the expansions for TL WDN using SADE-DP methodology

SADE_TL_lcc_flx1: Main function for designing the expansions for TL WDN for stage 1 using flexible design methodology

SADE_TL_lcc_flx2: MAin function for designing the expansions for TL WDN for stage 2 using flexible design methodology

SADE_TL_lcc_flx3: MAin function for designing the expansions for TL WDN for stage 3 using flexible design methodology

TL_lcc: Function  to estimate the LCC for TL WDN at the initial stage

TL_lcc_gen_exp: Function to estimate the LCC for the expanded network for TL WDN

DP_1_TL: Main function to design the expansion of TL WDN using DP
